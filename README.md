# The One-step AWS Network Orchestrator

Managing cloud networks and keeping everything connected can be a bit of a headache. Traditional tools like AWS NAT Gateway can cost you $40 a month or more, and you have to tinker for hours with the right setup to get started.

Say hello to **NAT autoM8** and **NAT M8** and Make cloud networking a breeze: cheaper, quicker, and way easier to use.

At its core, **NAT autoM8 is your cloud‚Äôs network orchestrator** ‚Äî *a tool that builds and automates your AWS VPC structure with the ease and efficiency of setting up a home Wi-Fi router*. It configures everything from subnets to route tables and associations and deploys **NAT M8**, *a super cost-effective and reliable NAT service that delivers seamless internet access to your private AWS systems*.

NAT autoM8 is a fully IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code) solution, ideal for hobbyists and businesses looking to optimise their cloud infrastructure while keeping costs low. It‚Äôs licensed under the **NATM8 Public Licence**, ensuring source-available transparency.

## :warning: Performing Updates

After deployment one can make changes on the infrastructure parameters such as adding or removing instance types. 

In some regions this will lead to following error 
  ![*Template error: Fn::Select cannot select nonexistent value at index 1*](docs/UpdateStackError.png)
due to **AWS side parsing logic bug** in the *Use existing template* workflow. 

The solution to this is issue is to use *Replace your existing template with a new template* 
![](docs/UpdateStack.png)
option at stack update. With the new template the parameter update will succeed. At the next required parameter change, the template needs to be replaced again (with a template that can be identical to the existing template). As the replace existing template workflow does not have the parsing bug.
